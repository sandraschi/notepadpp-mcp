# Megatest Concept - Comprehensive Advanced Memory Integration Test
## End-to-End System Validation from Cold Start to Complex Operations

## 🎯 Overview

The **Megatest** is a comprehensive integration test suite that exercises Advanced Memory MCP through realistic usage patterns, edge cases, and error conditions. It validates the entire system from cold start through complex multi-project operations.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Production Data Safety

**THE MEGATEST MUST NEVER TOUCH PRODUCTION DATA!**

### Isolation Guarantees
1. ✅ **Separate test directory** - Completely isolated from production MD folders
2. ✅ **Separate test database** - In-memory or temporary file, NEVER production DB
3. ✅ **Explicit safeguards** - Multiple checks prevent accidental production access
4. ✅ **Test-only configuration** - Separate config file for test environment
5. ✅ **Cleanup on exit** - All test data deleted after completion (unless preserved for debugging)

### Safety Mechanisms
```python
# ENFORCED: Test cannot run if production paths detected
if is_production_path(config.db_path):
    raise RuntimeError("FATAL: Attempted to use production database!")
if is_production_path(config.home_dir):
    raise RuntimeError("FATAL: Attempted to use production MD folder!")

# ENFORCED: Test directory must be in temp or test-specific location
ALLOWED_TEST_PATHS = [
    Path("test_data/megatest/"),      # Relative test path
    Path(tempfile.gettempdir()),      # System temp directory
    Path.cwd() / "tests/megatest/data"  # Test-specific directory
]
```

### Pre-Flight Checks
Before ANY test operations:
1. ✅ Verify test directory is NOT in production path
2. ✅ Verify database is NOT production database
3. ✅ Create isolated test environment
4. ✅ Display test paths for verification
5. ✅ Require explicit confirmation if running outside pytest

## 📊 Multi-Level Test Strategy

### Test Levels (Pyramid Approach)

### Pytest Configuration
```python
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    megatest: Comprehensive integration test (90+ minutes, ISOLATED)
    megatest_quick: Quick validation (10 minutes, ISOLATED)
    megatest_phase: Individual phase tests (ISOLATED)
    destructive: Test performs destructive operations (MUST be isolated)

# SAFETY: Megatest ONLY runs with explicit marker
# This prevents accidental execution
addopts = -m "not megatest"

# Run megatest with EXPLICIT confirmation:
# pytest tests/megatest/ -v --tb=short --durations=20 -m megatest
```

### Safety Features in pytest.ini
```ini
[pytest]
# Prevent accidental execution

python_functions = test_*

# Megatest requires EXPLICIT marker
addopts =

## 📊 Metrics Collection

### Performance Metrics
```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = []
        self.timings = {}
        self.errors = []
    
    def record_operation(self, op_type, duration, success, details):
        self.operations.append({
            "type": op_type,
            "duration_ms": duration * 1000,
            "success": success,
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "details": details
        })
    
    def get_stats(self, op_type):
        ops = [o for o in self.operations if o["type"] == op_type]
        durations = [o["duration_ms"] for o in ops]
        return {
            "count": len(ops),
            "avg_ms": sum(durations) / len(durations) if durations else 0,
            "min_ms": min(durations) if durations else 0,
            "max_ms": max(durations) if durations else 0,
            "success_rate": sum(1 for o in ops if o["success"]) / len(ops) if ops else 0
        }
```
