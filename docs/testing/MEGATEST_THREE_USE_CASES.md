# Megatest: Three Major Use Cases
## Development, GitHub CI/CD, and End-User Validation

## 🎯 Overview

The megatest framework serves **three distinct audiences** with different needs:

1. 🔧 **DEVELOPERS** - Building and debugging the MCP server
2. 🤖 **GITHUB CI/CD** - Automated quality validation
3. 👤 **END USERS** - Validating their MCPB installation works

Each use case requires different configuration, expectations, and outputs.

---

## 🔧 USE CASE 1: DEVELOPMENT

### Who: Developers building the MCP server

### Goal: Fast feedback during development, easy debugging

### Configuration
```bash
# Location: Local repo (easy to find)
export MEGATEST_LOCATION=local

# Cleanup: Keep failures (for debugging)
export MEGATEST_CLEANUP=on-success

# Level: Quick smoke tests usually
pytest tests/megatest/ -m megatest_smoke  # 2 min
```

### Typical Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make code changes
vim src/advanced_memory/services/search_service.py

# 2. Run quick smoke test (2 min)
pytest tests/megatest/ -m megatest_smoke

# 3. If it passes, continue development
# If it fails, check test-results/megatest/latest/ for artifacts

# 4. Before committing, run standard test (10 min)
pytest tests/megatest/ -m megatest_standard

# 5. Commit if tests pass
git commit -m "feat: improved search"
```

### Output Location
```
repo/test-results/megatest/
├── 2025-10-15_09-30-45/  (deleted - passed)
├── 2025-10-15_10-15-20/  (deleted - passed)
└── 2025-10-15_11-45-30/  (KEPT - failed, for debugging)
    ├── test_data/
    ├── artifacts/
    ├── logs/
    │   └── errors.log  ← Check this for failure reason
    └── report.html
```

### Benefits for Developers
- ✅ **Fast feedback** (2-10 minutes)
- ✅ **Easy debugging** (artifacts preserved on failure)
- ✅ **Local access** (same directory as code)
- ✅ **No quota waste** (automated, not manual testing)
- ✅ **Confidence** (systematic validation before PR)

### Developer Commands
```bash
# Quick check (2 min)
just megatest-smoke

# Standard check (10 min)
just megatest-standard

# Full validation (90 min - before major changes)
just megatest-full

# With debugging (keep all artifacts)
MEGATEST_CLEANUP=archive pytest tests/megatest/ -m megatest_full
```

---

## 🤖 USE CASE 2: GITHUB CI/CD

### Who: Automated quality gates in GitHub Actions

### Goal: Prevent broken code from merging, validate every PR

### Configuration
```bash
# Location: Hidden (temp, clean)
export MEGATEST_LOCATION=hidden

# Cleanup: Immediate (save disk space)
export MEGATEST_CLEANUP=immediate

# Artifacts: Upload to GitHub
# (Artifacts saved BEFORE cleanup via separate step)
```

### GitHub Workflows (Multi-Level)

#### Fast CI (Every Push/PR)

## 👤 USE CASE 3: DEPLOYED AT USER (MCPB VALIDATION)

### Who: End users who installed your MCPB package

### Goal: **Prove the MCP server works in their environment**

### The Power of User Validation

When a user installs your MCPB (e.g., in Claude Desktop):

```bash
# User installs your MCPB
# Drag-and-drop advanced-memory-mcp.mcpb into Claude Desktop
# Or: Install via marketplace
```

**User's question**: *"How do I know this actually works?"*

**Your answer**: *"Run the validation test!"*

```bash
# User runs validation (from their terminal)
advanced-memory validate

# Or via pytest if they have it
pytest tests/megatest/ -m megatest_smoke
```

### Configuration for User Validation
```bash
# Location: Visible (Documents - they can inspect)
export MEGATEST_LOCATION=visible

# Cleanup: Archive (proof it worked)
export MEGATEST_CLEANUP=archive

# Level: Smoke (quick validation)
# Time: 2 minutes
```

### User Experience

#### Before Validation
```
User: "I installed Advanced Memory MCP via MCPB..."
User: "...but how do I know it's working?"
```

#### Run Validation
```bash
$ advanced-memory validate

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

#### After Validation
```
User: "WOW! It actually works! I can see the test results!"
User: *Opens Documents/megatest-results/2025-10-15_validation_PASS/*
User: *Sees generated test notes, artifacts, HTML report*
User: "This MCP server is HIGH QUALITY - they test everything!"
```

### Why This Is Powerful

#### 1. **Proves Quality** (Trust)
- User sees actual test execution
- User sees all tests pass
- User sees generated artifacts
- **Proof of quality** > marketing claims

#### 2. **Troubleshooting** (Support)
```bash
User: "MCP server doesn't work for me"
Support: "Please run: advanced-memory validate"

# If validation passes:
Support: "Your installation is fine, the issue is configuration"

# If validation fails:
Support: "Please send the report from Documents/megatest-results/"
Support: "We can diagnose the exact issue"
```

#### 3. **Demonstrates Capabilities** (Discovery)
- User sees what the MCP server can do
- Test creates sample notes, searches, exports
- **Shows features** through working examples
- User learns by inspecting test artifacts

#### 4. **Environment Validation** (Compatibility)
- Tests in **user's actual environment**
- Catches environment-specific issues
- Validates dependencies are installed
- Proves it works on their OS/configuration
